# Calorie Counter

The **Calorie Counter** project is a simple application that allows users to track their daily calorie _intake_ and _expenditure_. Users can input the names and calories of various meals, snacks, and exercises throughout the day. The app then calculates the total calories consumed and compares it to the user's set budget, displaying the remaining calories or any surplus.
